#  Co-ML Sample App
An MVP demo of using an .mlmodel from Co-ML to show live classification results.  It opens up a camera view and shows the top classification result.

## Instructions
1. Get an exported .mlmodel from the Co-ML app 
2. Drag the .mlmodel file into the file directory of this app.
3. Edit `Data > mydata.json` with the labels in your project
4. If needed, edit `Data > ClassifierData.swift` to include the same structure as any edits you made to `mydata.json` 
4. Run on device to view the demo.  
4. To stylize, you can edit the contents of `ContentView` (look for the TODO comment)
