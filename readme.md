#  Co-ML Sample App
An MVP demo of using an .mlmodel from Co-ML to show live classification results.  It opens up a camera view and shows the top classification result.

## Instructions
1. Get an exported .mlmodel from the Co-ML app (it's generated each time a model is trained).  Right now, there isn't UI to do it, but you can export the file manually from iOS toolbox, or ask Tiff about how to download it from CloudKit.
2. Drag the .mlmodel file into the file directory of this app.
3. Run on device to view the demo.  
4. To stylize, you can edit the contents of `ContentView` (look for the TODO comment)
