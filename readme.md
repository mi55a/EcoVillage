Welcome to EcoVillage, your map to a cleaner tomorrow! 



EcoVillage Features

- Easy access to the waste classifier

- Info about the waste where to dispose

- Map of waste, recycling, and composting sites in Chicago (WIP)

Note from Mily: created this app with Seanna and Sophia while at the KWK AI/ML Chicago camp and couldn't be prouder. This is a work in progress and hopefully we can continue to work on it.
